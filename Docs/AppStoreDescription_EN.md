## Writing Guidelines (Internal)

1. **No exaggeration**: Avoid "instant sync", "real-time updates" - widget policies don't allow this
2. **Mark optional features**: Live Activity, Shortcuts refresh, Controls are "optional"
3. **Emphasize privacy**: Default masking ON, minimal lock screen exposure
4. **Explain fallbacks**: Core features work with widgets even without Live Activity
